# JobsAndBoids

A sample project demonstrating Unity's Jobs system for GGJ Plovdiv 2023

## About sample

A simple boid simulation is impelmented with simple game objects and Unity's Jobs system.

Branches:
* `main` - game object implementation
* `jobs` - jobs implementation

1. Unity's solution - Job's System
    * A thread pool solution

1. Job Types
    * **IJob**: Runs a single task on a job thread.
    * **IJobParallelFor**: Runs a task in parallel. Each worker thread that runs in parallel has an exclusive index to access shared data between worker threads safely.
    * **IJobParallelForTransform**: Runs a task in parallel. Each worker thread running in parallel has an exclusive Transform from the transform hierarchy to operate on.
    * **IJobFor**: The same as IJobParallelFor, but allows you to schedule the job so that it doesnâ€™t run in parallel
    
1. Code demonstration
    * Make a simple job moving objects inside a containment 
    * Job dependencies

1. Burst compiler
    * Blittable data types
        * Have the same memory layout in safe and unsafe code
